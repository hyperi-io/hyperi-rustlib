# HTTP server

`HttpServer` is the axum-backed server that hosts the probe trinity,
the Prometheus exporter, the metrics manifest, and (opt-in) the
`/config` admin endpoint. `ServiceRuntime` starts it automatically when
the `http-server` feature is on — apps don't usually instantiate
`HttpServer` themselves.

Default port is 9090 (shared between probes and metrics — single
listener, single TLS config). The server respects the same
`CancellationToken` as the rest of the runtime so SIGTERM drains
in-flight requests before exit.

## Mounted endpoints

| Path | Wired by | What it returns |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| `/healthz` | `health` feature | 200 if process is alive (no dep checks — never restart on dep down) |
| `/readyz` | `health` feature | 200 if `ready_flag` is true AND all registered checks pass; 503 otherwise |
| `/startupz` | `health` feature | 200 after startup completes (K8s waits before flipping to liveness) |
| `/metrics` | `metrics` feature | Prometheus text exposition |
| `/metrics/manifest` | `metrics` feature | JSON catalogue of every registered counter/gauge/histogram |
| `/config` | opt-in via `enable_config_endpoint` | JSON dump of every registered config section, with secrets redacted |
| `/scaling/pressure` | `scaling` feature | Single `f64` 0.0–100.0 for KEDA external scaler polling |

Probes plus metrics on the same port keep K8s manifest concise — one
`containerPort: 9090`, three probes, one `ServiceMonitor`.

## Usage

The common case is implicit — `ServiceRuntime` calls `HttpServer::serve`
on your behalf. Apps that need to mount extra routes do it through
the runtime hook (or call `HttpServer` directly for tooling-style
apps):

```rust
use hyperi_rustlib::http_server::{HttpServer, HttpServerConfig};
use axum::{Router, routing::get};

let server = HttpServer::new(HttpServerConfig::from_cascade()?);
let app = Router::new()
    .route("/whoami", get(|| async { "dfe-loader" }))
    .merge(server.standard_routes());

server.serve_with_shutdown(app, shutdown.cancelled()).await?;
```

`standard_routes()` returns the merged router for probes, metrics, and
(opt-in) `/config`.

---

## Ready flag

The ready flag is an `Arc<AtomicBool>` the server hands out via
`ready_flag()`. The shutdown handler clears it before draining traffic,
so K8s sees `/readyz` flip to 503 BEFORE the cancellation token starts
draining work. That is what avoids in-flight requests dying mid-flight
during a rolling deploy.

```rust
let flag = server.ready_flag();
// Later, after init completes:
flag.store(true, Ordering::Release);
// Pre-stop hook (auto-wired by ServiceRuntime):
flag.store(false, Ordering::Release);    // K8s stops routing
tokio::time::sleep(PRESTOP_DELAY).await; // give K8s time to notice
shutdown_token.cancel();                  // now drain
```

---

## TLS

**In-process TLS termination is not supported.** The K8s pattern is to
terminate TLS at the ingress / service mesh and run cleartext in-pod.

`HttpServerConfig` exposes `tls_cert_path` / `tls_key_path`, but they are
**not wired** — setting either is rejected by `HttpServerConfig::validate()`,
which `serve` / `serve_with_shutdown` / `serve_with_handle` call before
binding, so a config expecting in-pod TLS fails loudly rather than silently
serving cleartext. Front the service with a TLS sidecar or ingress instead.

---

## Graceful shutdown

`serve_with_shutdown` takes any `Future<Output = ()>`; typical wiring
is `shutdown_token.cancelled()`. axum drains in-flight requests, then
the future returns.

For test wiring or programmatic shutdown, `serve_with_handle` returns a
`ShutdownHandle` you can call `.shutdown()` on plus a
`ServerFuture` you await for the drain.

---

## Config shape

```yaml
http_server:
  bind_address: "0.0.0.0:9090"
  enable_config_endpoint: false   # opt-in — exposes redacted /config
  tls:
    cert_path: /etc/dfe/tls.crt
    key_path:  /etc/dfe/tls.key
  request_timeout: 30s
```

## API surface

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `HttpServer::new(config)` | Build from explicit config |
| `HttpServer::bind(addr)` | Build with just a bind address |
| `.standard_routes() -> Router` | Probes + metrics + (opt-in) /config |
| `.serve(app)` | Run until the future is dropped |
| `.serve_with_shutdown(app, shutdown)` | Run until the shutdown future resolves |
| `.serve_with_handle(app)` | Returns (`ShutdownHandle`, `ServerFuture`) |
| `.set_ready(bool)` | Toggle the ready flag |
| `.is_ready() -> bool` | Read the ready flag |
| `.ready_flag() -> Arc<AtomicBool>` | Hand out the flag for external coordination |
| `ShutdownHandle::shutdown()` | Trigger graceful shutdown from outside |
